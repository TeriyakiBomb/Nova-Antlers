**Antlers** provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for **Antlers** the template language for Statamic.


## Language Support

Currently contains basic completions for (I think) all antlers tags and modifiers.

If I have spare time, I might port over the Antlers language server for VSCode, which is utterly awesome.
